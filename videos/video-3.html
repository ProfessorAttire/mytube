      Thor (AKA Pirate Software) and Dr. K are back together for another
      interview! In full interview they go over Thor's recent success with his
      Game Jam and how he used social engineering to get members of his
      community to try creating a game for the first time. The dove into Thor's
      experience with homelessness and who he was before and after that
      experience in his life. They also go over Dharma and ego! Lots to get
      through in this almost 5 hour interview.
