# MyTube Devslopes Assignment

An assignment I completed as part of Devslopes HTML course


Requirements:

This is to be done with HTML ONLY

The index.html  file will be the "home page" of your website.

Your website will have four (4) pages. The navbar will include 4 links to get to these different pages:

Home page: This will show 3 "featured" videos (1 from each collection) - Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed full screen.

Collection pages: 
You will have three (3) collections/category pages.
Each page will have a collection of YouTube videos of your choice (i.e. Cars).
Each collection page will have six (6) videos relevant to the collection/category.
Videos on this page SHOULD NOT be allowed full screen.
Each YouTube video will have a clickable title beneath it that navigates the user to its "video details page"

Video details page:
This page should include the YouTube video associated with the title that was clicked, along with its title and a short paragraph about the video. You can use lorem ipsum text for video descriptions.
Videos on this page WILL be allowed full screen.

Video Upload page:
This will include a form (non-functional) to mimic "uploading" videos to your channel.
The <input> and <label> elements should include ALL required attributes as if it were a working form.
Pay special attention to the form mockup below to know what elements the form must include.
The radio buttons must toggle correctly (one selected at a time)

HTML must follow a consistent indentation pattern.

No large gaps/empty space between elements.

Footer - Place an <hr> tag just above the <footer> and add the following text inside the footer: &copy; Copyright"
